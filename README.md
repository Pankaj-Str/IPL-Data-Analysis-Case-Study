### Explanation of the Datasets

#### 1. `matches_data.csv`
This dataset contains match-level information for IPL matches. Each row represents a single match, with details about the teams, venue, date, and match outcome. Based on typical IPL match datasets, the likely columns include:
- **id**: Unique identifier for the match.
- **season**: The year or season of the IPL (e.g., 2008, 2009).
- **city**: City where the match was played.
- **date**: Date of the match.
- **team1**, **team2**: The two teams playing the match.
- **toss_winner**: Team that won the toss.
- **toss_decision**: Decision to bat or field after winning the toss.
- **result**: Outcome of the match (normal, tie, no result).
- **winner**: Winning team.
- **player_of_match**: Player awarded as the match's best performer.
- **venue**: Stadium or ground where the match was played.
- **umpire1**, **umpire2**: Names of the umpires.
- **win_by_runs**, **win_by_wickets**: Margin of victory (runs or wickets).

#### 2. `deliveries_data.csv`
This dataset contains ball-by-ball details for each match, providing granular data about each delivery bowled. Likely columns include:
- **match_id**: Identifier linking to the match in `matches_data.csv`.
- **inning**: Inning number (1 or 2).
- **batting_team**: Team batting during the delivery.
- **bowling_team**: Team bowling during the delivery.
- **over**: Over number (1 to 20 in T20).
- **ball**: Ball number within the over (1 to 6, excluding extras).
- **batsman**: Player facing the delivery.
- **non_striker**: Batsman at the non-striker's end.
- **bowler**: Player bowling the delivery.
- **is_super_over**: Indicator if the delivery was in a super over (0 or 1).
- **wide_runs**, **bye_runs**, **legbye_runs**, **noball_runs**, **penalty_runs**: Runs scored via extras.
- **batsman_runs**: Runs scored by the batsman off the delivery.
- **total_runs**: Total runs scored on the delivery (batsman runs + extras).
- **player_dismissed**: Player dismissed on the delivery (if any).
- **dismissal_kind**: Type of dismissal (e.g., caught, bowled, run out).
- **fielder**: Fielder involved in the dismissal (if applicable).

### Basic Questions for Analysis
These questions are suitable for beginners and focus on simple aggregations and insights:
1. **Which team has won the most matches in the IPL?**
   - Analyze the `winner` column in `matches_data.csv` to count wins per team.
2. **What is the average win margin (by runs and wickets) for matches?**
   - Use `win_by_runs` and `win_by_wickets` from `matches_data.csv` to compute averages.
3. **Which player has won the most "Player of the Match" awards?**
   - Count occurrences in the `player_of_match` column in `matches_data.csv`.
4. **How many matches were played in each season?**
   - Group by `season` in `matches_data.csv` to count matches per season.
5. **Which venue hosted the most IPL matches?**
   - Analyze the `venue` column in `matches_data.csv` to count matches per venue.
6. **What is the total number of runs scored by each team in the IPL?**
   - Use `batting_team` and `total_runs` from `deliveries_data.csv` to sum runs per team.
7. **Which bowler has taken the most wickets in the IPL?**
   - Count dismissals in `player_dismissed` where the `bowler` is credited in `deliveries_data.csv`.
8. **What is the distribution of toss decisions (bat/field) across seasons?**
   - Group by `season` and `toss_decision` in `matches_data.csv`.

### Advanced Questions for Analysis
These questions require more complex analysis, such as joining datasets, calculating metrics, or performing time-series analysis:
1. **What is the batting strike rate of each batsman in the IPL, considering only players with at least 500 runs?**
   - Calculate strike rate as (total `batsman_runs` / balls faced) * 100, filtering for players with significant runs.
2. **Which team has the highest run rate in the powerplay overs (1‚Äì6) across all seasons?**
   - Filter `deliveries_data.csv` for overs 1‚Äì6, sum `total_runs`, and divide by overs faced per team.
3. **How does winning the toss impact match outcomes for each team?**
   - Join `matches_data.csv` (`toss_winner`, `winner`) and analyze win percentages when teams win/lose the toss.
4. **Which bowler has the best economy rate in death overs (16‚Äì20) with at least 50 overs bowled?**
   - Filter `deliveries_data.csv` for overs 16‚Äì20, calculate economy rate (runs conceded per over), and filter by overs bowled.
5. **What is the impact of batting first vs. second on match outcomes across seasons?**
   - Analyze `matches_data.csv` for `toss_decision` and `winner` to compare win rates for batting first vs. chasing.
6. **Which batsman has the highest average against a specific bowler (minimum 30 balls faced)?**
   - Join `batsman` and `bowler` in `deliveries_data.csv`, calculate average runs per dismissal.
7. **How do dismissal types (caught, bowled, run out, etc.) vary by batting team and season?**
   - Group `deliveries_data.csv` by `batting_team`, `dismissal_kind`, and `season` from `matches_data.csv`.
8. **Can we predict the likelihood of a team winning based on venue and toss decision using logistic regression?**
   - Build a model using `matches_data.csv` with features like `venue`, `toss_decision`, and target as `winner`.

### Sample Artifact: Python Code for Basic Question 1
Below is a Python script to answer the question: "Which team has won the most matches in the IPL?"

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the matches dataset
matches_df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pankaj-Str/IPL-Data-Analysis-Case-Study/refs/heads/main/dataset/matches_data.csv')

# Count the number of wins per team
team_wins = matches_df['winner'].value_counts()

# Get the team with the most wins
most_wins_team = team_wins.idxmax()
most_wins_count = team_wins.max()

# Print the result
print(f"The team with the most IPL match wins is {most_wins_team} with {most_wins_count} wins.")

# Save the result to a CSV file
team_wins.to_csv('team_wins.csv')
print("Team wins data saved to 'team_wins.csv'.")
```
